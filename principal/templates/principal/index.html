                Since 2019 I study and develop personal web and desktop projects with Python and Django, with the intention of changing my professional career and improving myself more and more so that I can work as a programmer, be part of a development team, contribute to more advanced projects and have the possibility of increasing responsibilities and participation to generate value for an employer or a customer.

                Since 2004 to the end of 2018, I worked as a Freelancer, creating management systems in Excel and performing IT services.
